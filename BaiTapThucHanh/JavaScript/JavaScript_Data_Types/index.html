<p>You can use quotes inside a string, as long as they don't match the quotes surrounding the string:</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
var answer1 = "It's alright";
var answer2 = "He is called 'Johnny'";
var answer3 = 'He is called "Johnny"';

document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
answer1 + "<br>" + 
answer2 + "<br>" + 
answer3;
